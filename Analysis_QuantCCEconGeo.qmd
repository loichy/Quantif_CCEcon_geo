# Important note: to run this code, open first the R project "Quantif_CCEcon_geo.Rproj"

##### Clean memory
rm(list=ls())
gc()

##### Only required package to initiate is pacman
# Install and load packages (other packages are install and loaded from "00_PrepareEnvironment.R")
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(here)


#####  Precised relative access to useful Rcodes
dir <- list() # First create an empty list, that we then fill with subobjects
dir$root <- getwd() # First: the place of the R project
dir$rcode <- paste0(dir$root, "/RCode")

##### Prepare working environment
# Run R scrit "00" which contains all useful package, and creation of all directories
source(here(dir$rcode, "00_PrepareWorkingEnvironment.R"))
```

# Introduction

In this analysis, we document the geography of the economics of climate change. In particular,
we analyze where and when the economics of climate change has developed as a field. We also bring some explanations to the fact that some countries have provided more analysis on the topic than others.
